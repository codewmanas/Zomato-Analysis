## Introduction
In this project, we analyze Zomato data to uncover insights and trends. Our goal is to use Python and various data science libraries to perform a comprehensive analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Data Collection
We collected the data from Zomato's API and various other sources. The data includes information about restaurants, cuisines, locations, and user ratings.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in our analysis. We handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies in the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This step involved summarizing the main characteristics of the data using visual methods.

## Visualizations
Visualizations help in better understanding the data. We used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various plots and charts to visualize the data.
